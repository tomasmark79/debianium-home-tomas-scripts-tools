# For You

It might be useful for you to look at the individual files that I considered appropriate to publish. The repository is gradually expanding with the necessary files and is used mainly for sharing these tools between individual servers that I manage in the SmartHome IT environment.
The most interesting is probably the file *** m ***, which serves as a default script for all basic operations, which are often repeated.
